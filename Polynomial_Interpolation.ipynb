    "\n",
    "Given data points $(x_0,f(x_0)),\\dots,(x_n,f(x_n))$, presumably the output of some unknown, but sought, function $f$, we want to connect them either by a single polynomial $p(x)$ passing through all of them, or by separate polynomials each interpolating an adjacent pair of points.  The goal is to *approximate* the $y$-values of $f$ by those of $p$, in order that we may *approximately evaluate* $f(x)$ at other $x$ values besides the ones given, $x_0,\\dots,x_n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theoretical justification for this optimism in the form of the **Weierstrass approximation theorem**[^2], which says that polynomials are dense among the continuous functions on a compact interval $[a,b]$ in the supremum norm, $\\lVert f\\rVert_\\infty=\\sup_{x\\in [a,b]}|f(x)|$.  That is, $\\text{Closure}(\\mathbb{R}[a,b])=C([a,b])$[^1] in the technical sense that \n",

    "This of course requires the unknown $f$ to at least belong to $C([a,b])$.  If we opt for a single polynomial for the dataset, then we need $p$ to pass *through* those $n+1$ points in $[a,b]$, and this puts a hefty restriction on $f$, which then needs to belong to $C^{n+1}([a,b])$ to work.  This is one reason to consider *piecewise* interpolants, which make no demands on $f$ other than continuity.  Instead, we pay a heavier price in deriving the algorithms for the interpolants.  \n"
