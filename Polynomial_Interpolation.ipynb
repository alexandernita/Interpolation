Since we don't know $f(x)$, we try to ***guess*** its other $y$-values by means of some known simple function, like a line or a polynomial.  This ***connecting*** of the dots by a guessed function of convenience is called ***interpolation***.  There are ***two basic methods***:\n",

This is one reason to consider *piecewise* interpolants, which make no demands on $f$ other than continuity.  Instead, we pay a heavier price in deriving the algorithms for the interpolants.  \n"
