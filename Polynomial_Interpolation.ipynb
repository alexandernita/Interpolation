Since we don't know $f(x)$, we try to ***guess*** its other $y$-values by means of some known simple function, like a line or a polynomial.  This ***connecting*** of the dots by a guessed function of convenience is called ***interpolation***.  There are ***two basic methods***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting ***all*** $n+1$ points by a ***single polynomial*** $p(x)$ passing through each of them.\n",
    "2. Connecting ***each pair*** of data points by ***different polynomials*** (of the same degree) each interpolating one adjacent pair of points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal, of course, is to ***approximate*** the $y$-values of $f$ by those of our guess, $p$, in order that we may ***approximately evaluate*** $f(x)$ at other $x$ values besides the ones given, $x_0,\\dots,x_n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theoretical justification for this optimism in the form of the **Weierstrass approximation theorem**, which says that polynomials are dense among the continuous functions on a compact interval $[a,b]$ in the supremum norm, $\\lVert f\\rVert_\\infty=\\sup_{x\\in [a,b]}|f(x)|$.  That is, $\\text{Closure}(\\mathbb{R}[a,b])=C([a,b])$ in the technical sense that \n",

    "This of course requires the unknown $f$ to at least belong to $C([a,b])$.  If we opt for a single polynomial for the dataset, then we need $p$ to pass *through* those $n+1$ points in $[a,b]$, and this puts a hefty restriction on $f$, which then needs to belong to $C^{n+1}([a,b])$ to work.  This is one reason to consider *piecewise* interpolants, which make no demands on $f$ other than continuity.  Instead, we pay a heavier price in deriving the algorithms for the interpolants.  \n"
