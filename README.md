# Polynomial Interpolation of Data Points, Piecewise Linear Interpolation and Cubic Splines

## Single Polynomial Interpolation of n Data Points

Given data points $(x_0,f(x_0)),\dots,(x_n,f(x_n))$, presumably the output of some unknown, but sought, function $f$, we seek to connect them by a single polynomial $p(x)$, with the hope of *approximating* $f$ by $p$, in order that we may *evaluate* $f(x)$ at other $x$ values besides the ones given, $x_0,\dots,x_n$.
